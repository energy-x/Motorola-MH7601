# Motorola-MH7601

I know this is a Broadcom device, but I picked up a set of 3 for $10 at Amazon to play around with. I was able to get a serial connection and reset the root password on the device. It is running some custom version of OpenWrt and the web interface points to a landing.html under /www/luci-static/resources that just tells you to download an app. I realize a fully supported and working open version of OpenWrt is likely not happening, but if I can get Luci working to speed up clearing off the junk configs and potential spyware services I could use it as an AP. Here is the boot log along with version information. What other information can I gather to help? Thanks!
